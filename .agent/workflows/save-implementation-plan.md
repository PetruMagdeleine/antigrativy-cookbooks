description: Save the latest implementation plan artifact into a project file.
---

1. Read the implementation plan artifact from its location in the Brain directory.
   - Example location on MacOS: `/Users/[user]/.gemini/antigravity/brain/[CURRENT_SESSION_ID]/implementation_plan.md`.
2. Determine the destination path. If the user didn't specify one, ask where in the project they'd like to save it.
3. Write the content of the implementation plan artifact into the new project file.
4. Confirm to the user that the file has been saved.
