description: Save the latest walkthrough artifact into a project file.
---

1. Read the walkthrough artifact from its location in the Brain directory.
   - Example location on MacOS: `/Users/[user]/.gemini/antigravity/brain/[CURRENT_SESSION_ID]/walkthrough.md`.
2. Determine the destination path. If the user didn't specify one, ask where in the project they'd like to save it.
3. Write the content of the walkthrough artifact into the new project file.
4. Confirm to the user that the file has been saved.
